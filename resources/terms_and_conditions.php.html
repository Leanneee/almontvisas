<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 25px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Almont Ltd will also provide the individual with a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. This will normally be in electronic form if the individual has made a request electronically unless he/she agrees otherwise.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 25px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">If the individual wants additional copies, Almont Ltd will charge a fee, which will be based on the administrative cost to Almont Ltd of providing the additional copies.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 25px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">To make a subject access request, the individual should send the request to John Polydorou. In some cases, Almont Ltd may need to ask for proof of identification before the request can be processed.

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 25px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Almont Ltd will normally respond to a request within a period of one month from the date it is received.

Alternatively, Almont Ltd can agree to respond but will charge a fee, which will be based on the administrative cost of responding to the request. A subject access request is likely to be manifestly unfounded or excessive where it repeats a request to which Almont Ltd has already responded. If an individual submits a request that is unfounded or excessive, Almont Ltd will notify him/her that this is the case and whether or not it will respond to it.</div>

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 25px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Some of the processing that Almont Ltd carries out may result in risks to privacy. Where processing would result in a high risk to individual&rsquo;s rights and freedoms, Almont Ltd will carry out a data protection impact assessment to determine the necessity and proportionality of processing.
